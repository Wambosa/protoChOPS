chops database thoughts and relations

STEP1
thinking that we will recieve a message and store it in the recievedMessage table, then process ABC_Parse will look over the table, parse what it can and create job records and respone records.
STEP2
Process 123_jobHandler will work the job and update the jobStatus table appropiately.
STEP2b
When the 123_jobHandler updates a status, it also creates a response record that can potentially pass messages back to the sender(s).
STEP3
XYZ_messenger service can read the response table and send messages out if they have not been sent already.



job
jobId, jobStatusId, commandId, userId, lastUpdated

user
userId, userName, linqAddress, emailAddress, lastActivity

userPref
userId, prefKey, prefValue, prefDataType


commands (low level version)
commandName, serverIp, socket, responseType, 

commands (powershell version)
commandName, responseType?


recievedMessage (used to create jobs)
messageType, fromUserName, recievedText, tryParsedUserId, tryParsedCommandId, createdOn,

response
recievedMessageId, jobId, responseTextBackToUser
